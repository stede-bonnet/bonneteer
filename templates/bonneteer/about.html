<h1>How Bonneteer Works</h1>

<h2 class="aboutHeader">Getting trusted sites</h2>
<p class="aboutText">Bonneteer updates its database of trusted sites weekly by getting the megathread from the r/PiratedGames sub, parsing its content and spitting out a list of trusted releases and websites</p>

<h2 class="aboutHeader">Getting trusted repackers</h2>
<p class="aboutText">With the list of trusted releases and safe sites, bonneteer requests all sites by threading, and returning the page where the release was found, future versions will include direct links</p>

<h2 class="aboutHeader">The name</h2>
<p class="aboutText">Stede bonnet  was an early eighteenth-century Barbadian pirate, sometimes called "The Gentleman Pirate" because he was a moderately wealthy land-owner before turning to a life of crime.
    Most people pirating games can probably buy them, but why do that when you can pirate them, the Bonnet way!
